        "Description: The beobot robot has 5 camera streams and a pointcloud stream. The data is recorded as a rosbag file and consists of a stream of images and pointclouds along with other metadata and streams. The images are recorded at 15Hz and the pointclouds are recorded at 10Hz. Since the bandwidth on a single computer is limited, we placed 5 computers on the robot. The LiDAR and a camera sensor is connected to a computer and the remaining 4 cameras are connected to 4 other computers (each camera connected to a single computer). A specific data collection in an arbitrary day would consist of 5 folders: cam1, cam2, cam3, cam4 and cam5. Each of these folders would consist of a set of .bag corresponding to a data collection \"session\" on that day. Ideally, you should find an equal number of bag files in each of these folders, but it might so happen that a connection to a specific camera got disrupted due to reasons like the connector getting loose etc. The objective of this issue is to combine the streams of all the bag files into a single bag file, corresponding to a specific session, by aligning the timestamps since all the bag files are recorded separately. Please state your assumptions and there are many of ways of solving this problem. Your program has to be robust to missing bag files for a camera for that specific session, different bag file lengths/number of messages for different cameras etc.\n",

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "This script will merge user inputted files into an output file located at the user inputted output directory. The name of the file will be based on the session number the user inputted as well. Some of the main drawbacks regarding this script is the lack of automation. I was hoping to write a script that will open the 2023\\_\\*\\_\\*/ folder automatically and merge the files inside each of the 5 camera folders. However, some of the main difficulties I encountered are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Timestamps inside the folders are very off. Some of the files are dated in March and some are dated in December. I emailed Henghui and Henghui said this is the result of hardware having different system time onboard. To resolve this issue, I calculated the offset and applied them to the messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a camera folder, let's say cam2, is missing a session 2 bag file. How can the script tell that a bag file with time stamp in December 2023 should be in the same session as the session 3 bag file from the remaining other camera folders. The timestamps are so off to begin with that I found difficulties working with an autonomous option. An attempt to solve this issue is to do this process manually. By having user inputs, the script can process these bag files without worrying if the files are incorrect. The burden of having a valid bag file will fall on the user and not the script.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Possible Errors\n",
        "There are some errors that occur when using the Foxglove studio is view the merged bag file since the file is so large. An error message such as \"The requested file could not be read, typically due to permission problems that have occurred after a reference to a file was acquired.\" could appear. This is mainly due to the restrain with the arrayBuffer built into the browser. More info can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63376248/domexception-the-requested-file-could-not-be-read-typically-due-to-permission.  I believe this is an issue with the ROS viewer by Foxglove rather than an issue with the script. Moreover, I am aware of the compression flag for writing the bag file but I am not sure how it will affect the quality of the data stored inside each bag files.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Update**: Using the desktop version of Foxglove Studio seems to work a lot better.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future goals\n",
        "I am hoping to alter the script in a way such that the script will take the size of the files into account and group the files in similar size into a session. However, possible errors such as similar sizes files are misplaced in the wrong bucket can arise. Or utilize the timestamp of when these files are created to help sort the files into buckets. Interestingly, the online viewer Foxglove can still view the image messages even if they are out of sequence. I believe this is because it utilizes sql to sort the messages before displaying. I read this somewhere in the ROS forum but is not too sure. I would like to also sort the messages after merging to decrease the load on the Studio."
